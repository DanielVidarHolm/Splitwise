## My process


### Built with

- **HTML5** Semantic markup
- **CSS** custom properties
- **SASS/SCSS**
- **Node.js** Object oriented programming
- **Express** for routing
- **EJS** for templating
- **Render** for Web service hosting
- **Mobile-first** workflow
- **Canva** for image editing


### Challenges

Decided to go with SASS instead of css. I was challenged with learning a new way to organize my css.

I had some challenge on writing the script becouse there was a lot of variable to keep an eye on for example changing the colors of the text when clicking on a checkbox. 

### Continued development

In the future i will optimize my Sass code to be more efficent. I want to add more modules. 

I will abstract my code better in future, Encapsulate the calculator in a class


### Useful resources

- [Sass docs](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - This helped me for understanding the syntax of the Sass language and to better abstract my Sass
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Looked up the MDN for general questions
